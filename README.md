## üìù Overview

**E-Waiter** is a modern restaurant management app built with the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It streamlines order processing, real-time communication, and customer service for restaurants. The app uses **Appwrite** for secure authentication and image storage, and **Socket.IO** for instant updates between waiters, chefs, and admins.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Order Updates:** Live communication between staff, kitchen, and admin via Socket.IO.
- **Role-Based Dashboards:** Distinct interfaces for waiters, chefs, and admins.
- **Authentication & User Management:** Secure login and user roles powered by jsonwebtoken.
- **Image Storage:** Images stored and managed with Appwrite.
- **Interactive UI:** Built with React, including live notifications (react-hot-toast).
- **Robust Data Handling:** Orders, menus, and users managed with Mongoose and MongoDB.

### Usage

- Each table has a dedicated system where users (customers) can browse the menu and place orders directly from their table.

- Once an order is placed:

     - Chefs are instantly notified and can update the order status from "Processing" to "Processed".

     - When an order is marked as "Processed", the Waiter receives a real-time notification.

     - Waiters can then update the order status from "Yet to Deliver" to "Delivered".

- During each stage of the order lifecycle, the Admin is notified of the updates.

- Admins also have full control to manage menus, users, and monitor order analytics.

- Images for menu items and users are securely uploaded and managed using Appwrite.
